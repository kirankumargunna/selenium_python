Data Driven Testing is a strategic approach that involves executing a set of test script actions in a repetitive manner, each time utilizing distinct input values sourced from an associated data repository. This technique enhances efficiency by decoupling the 'test_case' code from the underlying 'data_set' streamlining testing processes.


It is one of the widely-used automation testing best practices for verifying the behavior and efficiency of tests when handling various types of input values.

Here are the popular external data feed or data sources in data driven testing:

MS Excel Sheets (.xls, .xlsx)
CSV Files (.csv)
XML Files (.xml)
MS Access Tables (.mdb)
