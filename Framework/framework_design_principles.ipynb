    "When designing a Selenium framework in Python, key principles include using the Page Object Model (POM) to separate test logic from page-specific code, incorporating robust error handling, leveraging explicit waits to manage dynamic content, organizing tests with a testing framework like pytest or unittest, and ensuring proper data management, logging, and reporting mechanisms for maintainability and clarity; all while adhering to best practices like coding standards and design patterns for modularity and reusability"

    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "Definition: Internal details of each module or class should be hidden from others and accessed through a well-defined interface.  \n",
    "Benefit: Prevents unintended interference and provides a clear contract for using the class or module.  \n",
    "Example: In Selenium, create getter and setter methods for elements in the page classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "Definition: Implementation details should be abstracted away, exposing only necessary details.  \n",
    "Benefit: Simplifies interaction with the framework by hiding complexity.  \n",
    "Example: A login function can abstract the details of interacting with the login fields and button.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data-Driven Testing\n",
    "Definition: The framework should support running the same set of test cases with different data sets.  \n",
    "Benefit: It reduces the number of test cases and helps identify issues related to different inputs.  \n",
    "Example: Use CSV, Excel, or JSON files to store test data and iterate through them in your test cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keyword-Driven Testing\n",
    "Definition: The framework should allow the creation of test cases using predefined keywords that map to the operations to be performed.  \n",
    "Benefit: Non-technical users can write tests without knowing the underlying code.  \n",
    "Example: Keywords like Click, EnterText, and Verify can be used to define steps in a test case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inversion of Control (IoC) / Dependency Injection\n",
    "Definition: Objects should be provided with their dependencies, instead of creating them directly.  \n",
    "Benefit: It allows the swapping of components and supports unit testing and mocking.  \n",
    "Example: Pass the WebDriver instance to page classes instead of creating it within the class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling and Logging\n",
    "Definition: The framework should have robust error handling and detailed logging to make debugging easy.  \n",
    "Benefit: Helps diagnose issues during test execution and provides detailed information for troubleshooting.  \n",
    "Example: Use try-except blocks around critical test steps and log exceptions with details like stack traces and screenshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reporting and Analysis\n",
    "Definition: The framework should generate clear and detailed test reports that show test execution status, errors, and logs.  \n",
    "Benefit: Test reports are essential for stakeholders to understand the test outcomes.  \n",
    "Example: Integrate with reporting tools like Allure, HTMLTestRunner, or generate custom HTML reports.  "
